# Level Info Backgrounds

Adds a scrolling background similar to the main menu to the Level Info Layer.

This mod has a ton of customizable settings, be sure to modify them to your liking!

<cr>This mod looks like garbage for most 2.1 and 2.2 levels cuz everyone just neglects the background and ground colors, get your favorite creators to start caring again!</c>
